# Players

This directory holds several implementations of the Player interface found in `/game/player.go`. 
Each one is a different strategy for playing the game.

## DummyPlayer

File: `dummy.go`

This player is a dummy. It does nothing. It is used for testing.
It is a good template to follow to implement your own logic.

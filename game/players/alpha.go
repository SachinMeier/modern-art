uncertaintyFactor is a measure of how close the competition is for any spot on the podium
at the time of this player's auction. This is important because it means a (4,4,4,4,4) scenario
has zero uncertainty for the auctioneer, while it has very high uncertainty for bidding players.

Uncertainty is high when there are more than 3 artists "in the race".

Tiebreakers are significant factors in uncertainty. Manuel has much lower uncertainty than Rafael
because he can truly lock in second place.

Maximal uncertainty is (0,0,0,0,0).

TODO: although we won't currently account for this, uncertainty is further lowered with more cards by the
fact that we can guess who will play what. (3,3,3,3,3) is more certain than (1,1,1,1,1) because we know
who holds what.

Summary of the algo:
Factors:
- Number of pieces of this artist played
- Sum of art pcs played   phase.Len()
- GINI coefficient of cards played ???
- Tiebreaker value for artist   (5 - tiebreaker)

attempt?: (sum of MIN(top 3 || non-zeros)) / if(ct_zeros>2: 2*ct_zeros, else: sum of MAX(bottom 2 || zero) * tiebreaker

3 zeros means higher certainty for top 2 and lower certainty for bottom 3

TODO: this is a very rough first pass.
the current ranking of the artist is very important to uncertainty. However, it is mostly accounted for in the
competitiveness metric

for now: KISS! .8 + .01*played
alternative: 1-\left(\frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{8}+.8\right)}\right)}-.75\right)
